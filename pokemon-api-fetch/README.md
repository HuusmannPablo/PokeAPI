# PokeAPI
This application is intended to fetch information from an API list and show it on the screen.

I'll be working with the Pokemon API, which gives you information about every Pokemon created.

API List: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

You can search for a specific Pokemon by name, or display them all on pages of 20 at a time.
The buttons to select the function you want were made with Materials UI.

HOW TO RUN IT:
The site is deployed at:
https://pokemon-api-fetch.web.app/

If you want to run it locally, clone the code, and run it through the console. 
Run the command:

  ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Future features:
  Search bar to handle misspelling mistakes and 404.
  Filter by type from a dropdown list.

If you have any suggestions please get in touch!
