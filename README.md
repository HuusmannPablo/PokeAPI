# PokeAPI
This application is intended to fetch information from an API list and show it on the screen.

I'll be working with the Pokemon API, which gives you information about every Pokemon created.

API List: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

You can search for a specific Pokemon by name, or display them all on pages of 20 at a time.
Those buttons to select the function you want are made with Materials UI.

Future features:
  Search bar to handle misspelling mistakes and 404.
  Page to be hosted for everyone to use.
  Filter by type from a dropdown list.

If you have any suggestions please get in touch!
