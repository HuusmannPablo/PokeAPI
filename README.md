# PokeAPI
This application is intended to fetch information from an API list and show it on the screen.

I'll be working with the Pokemon API, which gives you information about every Pokemon created.
API List: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

I will only show 20 Pokemon per page.
The app will have buttons for the previous and next pages.

Future features:
  Search bar to display only the requested Pokemon by name.
  To display more than one result for partial naming.
  Filter by type from a dropdown list.

If you have any suggestions please get in touch!
