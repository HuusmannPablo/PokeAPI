# PokeAPI
This application is intended to fetch information froman API endpoint, and show it in the screen.

I'll be working with the Pokemon API, which gives you information about every pokemon created.
I will only use the first 151 Pokemon, and will work in the best way to present the information on screen.

For future features, I'll make a series of filters to display only the requested pokemons.

If you have any suggestion please get in touch!
